# Savepoint Skill: Build Task

## Purpose

Implement one active task exactly as planned, prove each acceptance criterion, run the quality gates, and hand control back to the user.

## Trigger

Use this skill when router `state` is `task-building`, or `defect-building` for a release defect repair.

Do not use this skill to review your own work. If the user explicitly asks to audit or re-audit the task, hand off to `savepoint-audit-task`; if the epic is complete or the router is `audit-pending`, hand off to `savepoint-audit-epic`. Both audits keep their own read scope and result contract.

## Read

- `.savepoint/router.md`
- Active epic detail file or active defect file
- Active task file when in `task-building`
- The `STYLE` rules in `.savepoint/Guardrails.md`, when the project has that file
- Only the files listed in the task `## Context Files`, unless the task itself requires a targeted verification read

## Workflow

1. Read the task acceptance criteria and implementation plan.
2. Before editing code, verify task frontmatter uses canonical lifecycle fields: `status`, and `stage` only when `status: in_progress`.
3. Set the task frontmatter to `status: in_progress` and `stage: build` when starting.
4. Mark the focused task as router priority in the TUI when available.
5. Implement the checklist in order and tick completed items, writing code that follows the `STYLE` rules in `.savepoint/Guardrails.md`. Skip this when the project has no `.savepoint/Guardrails.md`; its absence is not a finding.
6. Verify every acceptance criterion with a concrete outcome.
7. Run `make build && make test`.
8. Apply the `.savepoint/Health-Check.md` Quick check at task handoff and record its evidence block in the task `## Context Log`. Skip this step when the project has no `.savepoint/Health-Check.md`.
9. Fill the task `## Context Log` with files read/edited and quality-gate results.
10. Add `## Drift Notes` only if files/modules or architecture changed beyond the documented map/design.
11. Stop for user review; only the user may mark the task `done`.

## Rules

- Stay within the active task scope.
- Do not audit the epic you just built. Defer explicit audit and re-audit requests to `savepoint-audit-task` for one in-progress task, or `savepoint-audit-epic` for a completed epic.
- Do not use Savepoint CLI commands; edit files directly.
- Treat the `STYLE` rules as advisory Guideline severity: they shape the code you write, but never block handoff on their own.
- Do not restate the `STYLE` rules in task files, guides, or handoff notes; reference the rule IDs instead.
- Use `state` only for router phase, task `status` only for task lifecycle, and `stage` only when an item is `in_progress`.
- Never write `stage: implementation`; implementation work starts at `stage: build`.
- Treat legacy task `phase` as parser compatibility only; new task guidance and writes must use `stage`.
